// description of Argo
Argo is a text-mining workbench that can be used to combine UIMA components into text-mining workflows. Argo provides components for a number of text-mining purposes. In this application, we use Argo to annotate the following entities:

 * Chemicals
 * Metabolites
 * Proteins
 * Species

The Workflow we have created is shown below.

// description of each component in workflow

The Functionality of each component is described below:

 * TextWebServiceReader: Reads in text provided by a user through the REST API
 * LingPipe Sentence Splitter: Splits the input text into sentences using a model targeted at biologiacl texts.
 * OSCAR 4 Tokeniser: Takes the input text and splits it into tokens (i.e. continuous text units broken on whitespace, punctuation, etc.) Specifically tuned for Chemical texts
 * GENIA Tagger: Used to annotate the text with tokens, parts-of-speech, etc.
 * Chemical Entity Recogniser (Chemicals): Recognises Chemical names in the text according to a pre-trained model.
 * SPARQL Annotation Editor (Chemicals): Converts the output format (i.e. type) of the previous tool to a format which is required for output.
 * Species Tagger: Identifies Species names in the text
 * Duplicate Annotation Remover: Removes duplicated Species annotations
 * NERsuite Custom Tagger (Proteins): Tags the text with protein names using a custom CRF-based model.
 * Chemical Entity Recogniser (Metabolites): Idenitifies metabolite named entities in the text.
 * BioNLP ST Type System Loader (2): Makes sure that the correct Types are loaded in the Underlying Common Annotation Structure (CAS).
 * BioNLP ST WebService Writer: Writes the annotations to brat and returns the link to the file to the user.


== ChEBI web service
This worflow is wrapped up as a web service compliant with the OMTD platform. More information about the specifications of an OMTD web service can be found at: https://openminted.github.io/releases/processing-web-services/1.0.0/specification. The web service is available at: http://nactem.ac.uk/api/openminted/chebi/ (please be noted that this is not a web page hence cannot be accessed via web browsers).
