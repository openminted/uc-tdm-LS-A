= Showing Annotations of a Given Document

[[sect_showing_annotations]]

== Showing annotations of a given document

The application is currently focussed around this data processing scenario.

Currently, a use can navigate to the web form at: http://nactem.ac.uk/apps/openminted/chebi/ where they can enter their biological text for processing. The text is sent via a REST interface to a running Argo workflow, which processes the text for the entities of interest and returns the file path of the document that has been created. This is then processed to give the link to the file, visualised in brat.

// pic of Chebi app
The Web interface is shown in the image below:

The output of the workflow is displayed in brat as shown:

// info on rest interface
The REST interface is accessible at:

....
 http://argo.nactem.ac.uk/dev/proxy/webservice/<ServiceID>
....

Where <ServiceID> is a unique ID which locates the service. Currently, this is set at "384", although this is liable to change.

Users should submit a request via POST with the header: Content-type:text/plain

The function will return a filepath, the last element of which is the filename of the annotated document. This can be accessed in Brat by apending the filename to the URL: 

....
http://nactem10.mib.man.ac.uk/brat-v1.3/#/OpenMinted-ChebiApp/
....

A minimum working example in javascript is presented below:


....



//set up the HTTP Request
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("POST", 'http://argo.nactem.ac.uk/dev/proxy/webservice/<ServiceID>', true);

//Send the proper header information along with the request
xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "text/plain");

//Callback function for when the state changes (i.e. response is received
xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if(xhr.readyState == XMLHttpRequest.DONE && xhr.status == 200) {
      //Request success      
      var splitStr = xhr.responseText.split("/");
      var docName = splitStr[splitStr.length - 1];

      link = "http://nactem10.mib.man.ac.uk/brat-v1.3/#/OpenMinted-ChebiApp/" + docName;
    }//if
    else
    {
      //Request Failed
      console.log("Processing failed");
    }//else
}// function

//Send the request
xhr.send(document.getElementById('inputText').value); 
....
